This is Tic tac Toe
But its with single and multiplayer player option 
the AI is 83% accurate, and it mostly playes defensive, since the game is broken, the only options are only draw matches and in some faulty senario you can win or loss, 
eitherways it was fun designing and playing around with the AI.
Another TTT_AI - alternative Game code (FAULTY)
CHEERS!
